SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ISSUES

1. GENERAL APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM:

I felt comfortable with the project after completing my phase 2. In this phase it took me lot of time to understand the
program manager and its functionality. I have approached the problem by breaking it down the phase to several modules.
This phase nedds lots to be modified than the other phase. we have to introduce a program manager which schedules the jobs
that are in the system. I started my coding with designing the program manager first then pushing all the job related variables
to PCB, thereby allowing every process to have its own share of variables. It took me five days to code this phase.
Solving tb+error part was a bit hard and consumed lot of time.

2. LIST OF UTILITIES USED.

I have used IntelliJ IDE to code and have used java programming language.

The operating system I simulated is portable to different architectures and operating systems as
I chose Java which is machine independent. I would highly recommend JAVA programming for this assignment as it an
object oriented programming language which has more benefits like modularity as it allows to add more functionality
in future as discussed above.
